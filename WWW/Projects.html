				    <h1>Schlieren imaging system</h1>
				
				    <p> 
					    
					    Schlieren imaging can be used to photograph fluid-flow. A 2f optical system consisting of a LED light source and
					    a concave mirror can be used for Schlieren imaging. A knife edge is placed at the point where the LED comes to a focus.
					    The knife edge cuts out half of the light reflected from the mirror. A digital camera is placed behind the knife edge
					    to capture the image.
				    </p>

				    <p>
					    Any fluid-flow that occurs between the light source and the mirror is imaged by the camera. The fluid flow creates a density
					    gradient which causes the refractive index vary. This creates a distortion in the light. As the knife-edge cuts out half of the
					    light, the distortion/spatial variation of the light is converted to intensity variation. This intensity variation
					    is imaged by the camera.

				        A three-body gravitational system can be used to represent the planetary orbits in a solar system. Such a system is useful
					    in analyzing how the orbit of one planet is affected by another neighboring planet. A Earth-Jupiter-Sun system can be 
					    modeled as a three-body system. A hypothetical case is simulated where Jupiter is replaced with a planet having 500 times
					    the mass of Jupiter (referred here as Super Jupiter). The effect on the orbit of the Earth due to such a massive planet
					    is easily noticeable from the simulation shown in the video.
                        </p> <br>

            		    <p>
					    Newton's law of universal gravitation is used to model the forces.					
					    The equations of motion are numerically solved using the Runga-Kutta method. The program is coded in python (Jupyter notebook).

				    <h1>Electromagnetically induced transparency</h1>

				    <p> 
					    
					    Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
					    refers to the formation of a narrow transparency window
					    inside a wide absorption band due to destructive interference between two excitation pathways. EIT like
					    transmission can occur in metallic nano-structure due to interference between plasmonic modes.

					    A split-ring resonator (SRR) coupled plasmonic waveguide can demonstrate EIT like transmission.
					    By controlling the gap between the split rings, it is possible to design the stop-band and pass-band of the system. 
					     Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods are used to design and simulate such a system. The video on top shows
					     the power profile as the wavelength is swept. Dips in the power level in the waveguide can be observed at wavelengths
					     of approximately 1050 nm and 1200 nm.

					    Endomicroscopy allows real-time <i>in vivo</i> imaging with microscopic resolution. Endomicrscopes can be used 
					    to perform for optical biopsy for diagnosing breast carcinoma. The challenge is to design optical elements that
					    can fit inside a packaging whose size is no larger than conventional biopsy needles. An achromatic objective lens for 
					    endomicroscopy is designed where the elements diameters are limited to 1.5 mm. The operating wavelength range 
					    is 452-623 nm, which contains emission peaks of the fluorescent dyes used for breast cancer detection (Proflavine, 
					    Cresyl-Violet etc.) As the system is achromatic, two dyes can be imaged simultaneously. 
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>
					    The optical design was done	using Code V optical design software developed by Synopsys. The lens elements are assumed to
					    be injection molded optical plastics. Aspherical surfaces are used to correct for aberrations and field-curvature.	The 
					    final optimized design satisfied all the imaging requirements.

					    In a Fiber Raman Amplifier (FRA), signal amplification is achieved by feeding pumps through the same transmission fiber where the signals
					    are propagating. Through stimulated raman scattering (SRS), the signals interact with the pumps. Power is transferred from the pump wavelengths
					    to the signal wavelengths and amplification is achieved. The entire transmission fiber acts as a distributed amplifier. Designing a FRA 
					    involved selecting the wavelengths and the power levels of the pumps for a desired gain profile.
					    
					    
					    
				    </p> <br/>
				    <p>
					    Two different configurations of FRA are designed and optimized. Type I configuration consists of 5 backward propagating pump and Type II configuration consists of
					    4 backward propagating pump + 1 forward propagating pump. The power profile of the signals and the pumps though the fiber for these two
					    configurations are shown in the figures above. The numerical solver to analyze the system was coded in Matlab. More details about the
					    project can be found in:
